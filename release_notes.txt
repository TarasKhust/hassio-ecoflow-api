Bug Fixes - Binary Sensors Fixed

All binary sensors were using incorrect API keys that don't exist in the actual EcoFlow API response, causing them to always show 'off' state regardless of actual device state.

Fixed Sensors:
- Charging detection - Now correctly detects when device is charging
- Discharging detection - Now correctly detects when device is discharging  
- AC Input Connected - Now correctly shows AC power connection status
- Solar Input Connected - Now correctly shows solar panel connection status
- Battery Low - Now correctly triggers at <20% battery
- Battery Full - Now correctly triggers at 100% battery
- Over Temperature - Now correctly detects high temperature (>45°C)

Technical Changes:
- wattsInSum → powInSumW (charging detection)
- wattsOutSum → powOutSumW (discharging detection)
- acInPower → powGetAcIn (AC input)
- solarInPower → powGetPvH (solar input)
- soc → bmsBattSoc (battery level)
- bmsTemp → bmsMaxCellTemp (temperature)
- Threshold increased from 0W to 10W to avoid false positives

This is a critical bug fix. All binary sensors should now work correctly and reflect actual device state.
